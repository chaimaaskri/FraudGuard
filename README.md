## 📌 Ongoing Project Overview
This  work-in-progress project is a **Flask-based AI-powered fraud detection system** that analyzes transactions and flags suspicious activities in real time. It utilizes machine learning models to detect anomalies and provide fraud risk scores. The system is designed to assist businesses and organizations in identifying and preventing fraudulent transactions.

## 🚀 Features
- **Fraud Detection**: Uses ML models to analyze transactions and detect fraud.
- **REST API**: Exposes a /predict endpoint to classify transactions.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Sends notifications when fraud is detected.
- **Scalability**: Designed to integrate with other fraud prevention tools.
- **Flask Backend**: Lightweight and flexible framework for handling requests.

## 🏗 Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (for advanced models)
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL / SQLite (for storing transactions and results)
- **API Integration**: RESTful API with Flask
- **Front-end (Future Expansion)**: React.js or Streamlit for visualization
